# Process Watch

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/dotpy3/pswatch?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/dotpy3/pswatch)

A **very** simple Go package to start processes, and to be alerted when they die. Inspired by [ps-watcher](http://ps-watcher.sourceforge.net/ps-watcher.html) and [node-process-watch](https://github.com/samuelg/node-process-watch).
